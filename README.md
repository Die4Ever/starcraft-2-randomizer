# StarCraft 2 Randomizer

This is an extension mod that randomizes the stats of units for StarCraft 2 multiplayer. Now you can blame your losses on RNG! See if you can find a seed more balanced than the real game. Works for 1v1, 2v2, FFA, etc. We now also support [Crowd Control](https://crowdcontrol.live/guides/SC2Randomizer)!

To reduce the chances of getting something too strong or too weak, there are also bans (if the host chooses to enable them) and picks. Default settings will have bans disabled, and 2 factions for each race. A faction is a randomization of a race, so Terran Faction 1 and Terran Faction 2 will both be based on Terran but have differently randomized stats.

If the host chooses to enable the bans feature for extra competitiveness, players will ban what faction(s) they think are the strongest, your bans only affect your opponents.

Then you will pick which faction you think is the strongest (From whatever wasn't banned if bans are enabled).

You can press F12 any time during the game to see the changes again.
