# StarCraft 2 Balance Patch Randomizer

This is an extension mod that randomizes the stats of units for StarCraft 2 multiplayer. It's like a random balance patch generator! Now you can blame your losses on RNG! See if you can find a seed more balanced than the real game. Works for 1v1, 2v2, FFA, etc. We now also support [Crowd Control](https://crowdcontrol.live/guides/SC2Randomizer)!

(This used to just be called "Randomizer Mod" but now it's called "Balance Patch Randomizer")

![choose mod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30947252/230750614-3766e4f1-26c3-4ec6-9bea-2ddcadcdab3f.png)

## Options:

### Host Settings: (skipped in Competitive Mode)
![host settings](https://i.imgur.com/Nm9d8zl.png)

To reduce the chances of getting something too strong or too weak, there are also bans (if the host chooses to enable them) and picks. Default settings will have bans disabled, and only 1 faction for each race, so you get into the game more quickly. A faction is a randomization of a race, so Terran Faction 1 and Terran Faction 2 will both be based on Terran but have differently randomized stats.

## Advanced Options:

#### Bans Screen: (skipped by default)

If the host chooses to enable the bans feature for extra competitiveness, players will ban what faction(s) they think are the strongest, your bans only affect your opponents. Competitive Mode automatically enables this with 1 ban.

#### Picks Screen: (skipped by default)

Then you will pick which faction you think is the strongest (From whatever wasn't banned if bans are enabled).

## You can press F12 any time during the game to see the changes again.

## New Competitive Mode

There's also a new Competitive Mode available in the lobby options. This will skip the host's setup screen, default to 3 factions and 1 ban, and go straight to the bans screen.
