# StarCraft 2 Randomizer

This is an extension mod that randomizes the stats of units for StarCraft 2 multiplayer.

To reduce the chances of getting something too strong or too weak, there are also bans and picks. Default settings will give each race 3 factions, and each player 1 ban. A faction is a randomization of a race, so Terran Faction 1 and Terran Faction 2 will both be based on Terran but have differently randomized stats.

First players will ban what faction(s) they think are the strongest, your bans only affect your opponents.

Then you will pick which faction you think is the strongest from whatever wasn't banned.
